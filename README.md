a steganography based discord bot, made with 💚 using 🐍

once upon a time, there was this dude who was really bored. so he made a discord bot that could create incredible hidden messages that didn't even appear to be encrypted.

## 🥁 background

this bot was created to submit in [swas.py's bot jam](https://discord.gg/j3YzsdnRvx). once the topic (cryptography) was revealed, i immediately had my idea. i got to work, and well, here we are!

my initial idea for the bot was to use zero-width characters, as they were invisible, and as they aren't very well known about. but then i realized that i could also add lots of different types of cryptology, and i did. so here we are!
